                                Elon Reeve Musk ; born June 28, 1971 is a businessman and conservative political figure known for his key roles in the automotive company Tesla, Inc. and the space company SpaceX.
                                <p>
                                He is also known for his ownership of X Corp.

Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of January 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$426 billion.</p>
A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria. At the age of 18 he immigrated to Canada, acquiring its citizenship through his Canadian-born mother, Maye. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.

The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. </p>
    <p>In 2002, Musk acquired United States citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.
